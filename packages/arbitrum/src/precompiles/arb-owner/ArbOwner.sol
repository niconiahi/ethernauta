 * @title Provides owners with tools for managing the rollup.
 * @notice Calls by non-owners will always revert.
 * Most of Arbitrum Classic's owner methods have been removed since they no longer make sense in Nitro:
 * - What were once chain parameters are now parts of ArbOS's state, and those that remain are set at genesis.
 * - ArbOS upgrades happen with the rest of the system rather than being independent
 * - Exemptions to address aliasing are no longer offered. Exemptions were intended to support backward compatibility for contracts deployed before aliasing was introduced, but no exemptions were ever requested.
 * Precompiled contract that exists in every Arbitrum chain at 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070.
